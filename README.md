# Search-Movies

This project was an assignement in my Mobile App Development course I recently took. Through this app, I learned how to request and fetch data from an API, specifically from TheMovieDB. The basic requirements of this project were to simply allow a user to search a movie and display the results. A user should be able to click on any movie and be presented with some of the movies details. There was a creative portion where I was allowed to implement my own features. I decided to research and implement Core Data and endless scrolling, 


# Creative Portion:

Through reviewing Apple's Core Data Documentation and watching Youtube tutorials, I was able to allow a user to store their favorite movies to their devices. This allows the user to close the app and allow the data to be stored locally. The second feature I implemented was the "endless scrolling." In the home page of the app, the app shows movies that are "currently playing." It initially only shows 20 results. However, when I user scrolls to the bottom of the screen, 20 more results are requested and presented.
